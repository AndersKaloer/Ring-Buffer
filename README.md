Ring-Buffer
===========

A simple ring buffer (circular buffer) designed for embedded systems.

An example is given in [examples/simple.c](examples/simple.c).

The size of the memory buffer must be a power-of-two.

A new ring buffer is created using the ` ring_buffer_init(&ring_buffer, buff, sizeof(buff))` function:
```c
char buff[64];
ring_buffer_t ring_buffer;
ring_buffer_init(&ring_buffer, buff, sizeof(buff));
```

The module provides the following functions for accessing the ring buffer (documentation can be found in [ringbuffer.h](ringbuffer.h)):
```c
void ring_buffer_queue(ring_buffer_t *buffer, char data);
void ring_buffer_queue_arr(ring_buffer_t *buffer, const char *data, ring_buffer_size_t size);
uint8_t ring_buffer_dequeue(ring_buffer_t *buffer, char *data);
ring_buffer_size_t ring_buffer_dequeue_arr(ring_buffer_t *buffer, char *data, ring_buffer_size_t len);
uint8_t ring_buffer_peek(ring_buffer_t *buffer, char *data, ring_buffer_size_t index);
uint8_t ring_buffer_is_empty(ring_buffer_t *buffer);
uint8_t ring_buffer_is_full(ring_buffer_t *buffer);
ring_buffer_size_t ring_buffer_num_items(ring_buffer_t *buffer);
```
